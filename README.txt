This project was created as a graduation project and was named "Creating and teaching neural network to investigate its behavior in changing weather
conditions", without using any external library (i mean i did it all on my own). I just wanted to know what is neural network, deep learning and machine learning and try it.


To warn you - the UI is in Russian.
